>>>>> Program Menu Instruction <<<<<

There are 3 options you can choose:
  1. Normal mode option
  2. Manual mode option
  3. Adjacent option

>>>>> Normal Mode Option <<<<<
This option will run normal program using Dijkstra Algorithm 
to calculate the shortest path between 2 nodes: origin node and destination node.

>>>>> Manual Mode Option <<<<<
This option will run manual program by inputing origin node and multiple destination. 
It doesn't use Dijkstra to calculate shortest path, instead calculate distance 
per node per adjacent it connected. 

>>>>> Adjacent Option <<<<<
This option will show all adjacent lists of node from specified node. You will
input the node and the adjacent lists will appear.
